The cron expression in my script.py file is "0 20 * * *". 
This means that my job runs at the 0th minute of the hour. 
The 20 represents the hour of the day in which the cron job is scheduled for which would be
8 PM since it is in a 24-hour format. The *'s represent that the cron job will run every day at 8 PM.
